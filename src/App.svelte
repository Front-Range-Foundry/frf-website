    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><b>Can I build anything for FRF?</b></p>
    <p>Within reasonable bounds of ethics and feasibility.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Why Write articles?</b></p>
    <p>The web is, at its heart, a collection of linked information. While it's run entirely on code, most of this code is useless to the casual observer unless its reason for being and method of construction is well documented. With articles, FRF writers can capture the key values of the code they produce.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Does FRF have meetups?</b></p>
    <p>Not as such.</p>
    <p><b>What are FRF's current projects?</b></p>
    <p>We're so glad you asked.</p>
